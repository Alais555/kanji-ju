        <p className="description"> The limits one may face as they are eagerly taking a dip into the Anime world are endless when it comes to not knowing where to start their search. You are stuck between netflix and hulu that barely cover the basics of the anime world to other sites charging an arm and leg for you to be able to access quality material. Where Kanji-JU  comes in, is that  it  takes away the need to go pay expensive monthly subscription fees in order to access anime sites. If users do have to pay for our site, it would not exceed $10 as most cost around $25. Our application also gives users access to hundreds of shows that are guaranteed to satisfy all their anime desires. Whether you are new to the world of anime or experienced,  our website gives users that sign up with us the option to save their selections and access them at a later time, all at little to no cost.</p>
